## Project Title: ANALYZING SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS TO ADDRESS SDG GOAL 1-NO POVERTY

# Introduction

Sustainable development goal (SDG) 1; No Poverty, is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030, recognizing that poverty is not just about income but encompasses access to basic services like health, education, and clean water

# Objective

- By taking a data-driven approach, this project aims to: 
- Analyze socio-economic factors (income, literacy, healthcare access)
- Identify key poverty drivers and regional disparities as well as,
- Propose data-driven recommendations for effective poverty alleviation. 

# Key Socio-Economic Indicators for SDG1

Some key indicators include:
-	Income levels and distribution (Gini index)

-	Employment and unemployment rates

- Access to basic services like education, healthcare, etc. 

These indicators help identify the causes, distribution, and effects of poverty


# Dataset Structure

The dataset contains key indicators;

-	unemployment rate (%),
-	literacy rate (%), 
-	Healthcare access (%),
-	income per capita,
-	Gini index, 
-	life expectancy, and child mortality rate showing the poverty rate (%) across fifteen (15) countries between 2019-2023.


# Data Analysis 
Poverty rate across regions and countries

-	South America shows the highest poverty rate of 33.60% while Africa shows the least with 26.27%
-	Turkey is the country with the highest poverty rate of 43.21% while Pakistan has the least rate of 18.68%
-	Poverty rate increased progressively from 2019-2021, which could be as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

# Findings

Income Levels and Distribution

- Poverty reduces with increase in income per capita and vice versa. 
-	Significantly, higher Gini Index brings about increase in poverty rate.
  
Access to Basic Services

- Increase in poverty rate brings about reduction to access of basic services like healthcare and education

-	Unemployment rate increases with increase in poverty rate. As unemployment rate reduces, poverty rate also reduces.
	
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

-	After conducting a thorough review of the dataset, no errors, inconsistencies, or missing values were identified during the data cleaning process.
  
Tools Used:

- Microsoft Excel
- Power business intelligence (Power bi)

Recommendation
•	Reduce Inequality: Implement progressive taxation policies to reduce income inequality and fund public services such as healthcare, education etc. Wealth redistribution mechanisms like targeted transfers or subsidies can help close the gap between rich and poor.
•	Invest in Education and Skill Development: Increase access to education by ensuring that education is free, universal, and of high quality. Focus on both primary and secondary education, as well as vocational training, and adult literacy programs, to help individuals build the skills necessary for better employment opportunities. 
•	Provision of grants to help SMEs: SMEs help poverty reduction by providing employment and stimulating local economies.

      Conclusion
•	The relationship between socio-economic indicators and poverty is two-way dynamic — meaning, both factors influence each other in complex ways. 

•	Poverty and most of the socio-economic indicators move in opposite directions, although Gini Index is likely to move in the direction of poverty rate. 

•	The aim of SDG 1 is to eradicate poverty in all its forms, and some organizations like World bank and UNDP are working towards that by implementing comprehensive strategies and policies to achieve this goal.
